# GDevelop Raycaster
DISCLAIMER: LASTEST BUILD IS OLD, I AM WORKING ON AN ULTRA OPTIMIZED BUILD AND WILL NOT BE UPLOADED FOR A WHILE. FOR UPDATES, GO TO MY DISCORD https://discord.gg/w7DgQHej2k
This is for anyone to use and/or modify.
This is a 3D raycaster for GDevelop 5, and can be used for any purpose.
I recommend that you credit this GitHub page though.
Also i apologize if filenames are weird, gdevelop is kinda weird with filenames (at least with me)
